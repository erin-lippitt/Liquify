# Liquify

Welcome to Liquify! This package performs preprocessing and water classification on Landsat 8 data in `Python`.

Please bear with me as I am new to working with remote sensing data in Python and am trying things out!

## Getting Started with Liquify

### Liquify Dependencies:

If you are new to working with remote sensing data in Python, I suggest setting up the Earth Analytics Python Conda Environment (https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env).

This will setup a new conda working environment on your computer with all the dependent packages for liquify and other remote sensing work.

### Optional Functions:

Functions for loading and visualizing data can be found in `data_loading` and `imaging`. Users can import them when working with Liquify to have easily accessible options for data loading and visualization that pair well with the structure of Liquify.

They are, however, optional if the user has a preferred method for these.
